Let's build the Reels/Short Video Sharing web app using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend) with WebSockets. We'll start with the FastAPI backend.

Core Features

MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Upload short videos
View video feed (auto-play vertically like Reels)
[1] Client uploads to S3 using presigned URL
[2] Client sets draft editing & post info (VideoDraft)
[3] Client clicks “Post”
[4] Backend:
     - validates the draft
     - pulls all relevant fields
     - creates a `Video`
     - deletes the draft (or marks finalized)
Like a video
Add comments
User registration/login (JWT)
Infinite scrolling
Real-time like/comment updates (WebSockets)


Video Router Responsibility Breakdown
1. video_create_router.py
Handles:

POST /videos/upload-url — Get pre-signed S3 URL

POST /videos/drafts — Create video draft

PATCH /videos/drafts/{draft_id} — Update editing fields

POST /videos/finalize — Finalize draft into public video

GET /videos/drafts/{draft_id} — Get draft info (if needed)

2. video_manage_router.py
Handles:

DELETE /videos/{video_id} — Delete a video

PATCH /videos/{video_id}/privacy — Update privacy

PATCH /videos/{video_id}/feature — Mark as featured

PATCH /videos/{video_id}/details — Update video details (desc, tags, etc.)

3. video_explore_router.py
Handles:

GET /videos/{video_id} — View video details

GET /videos/user/{user_id} — User's videos

GET /videos/stream/{video_id} — Get playback URL

GET /videos/thumbnail/{video_id} — Thumbnail URL

GET /videos/featured — Discover featured videos

GET /videos/search — Search videos

POST /videos/{video_id}/views — Increment views

4. video_interact_router.py
Handles:

POST /videos/{video_id}/like — Like

DELETE /videos/{video_id}/unlike — Unlike

GET /videos/{video_id}/likes — Who liked

POST /videos/{video_id}/comment — Comment

GET /videos/{video_id}/comments — Comments list



Tech Stack

Backend FastAPI + MongoDB (via Motor)
Video Storage AWS S3 (via boto3)
Frontend React + Tailwind + useEffect hooks
Auth JWT (FastAPI backend+ python-jose + localStorage on frontend)
Frontend React + Tailwind CSS
Real-time FastAPI WebSockets












Great — since you've completed your **database models** for the MVP using Pydantic + Motor + FastAPI, the next logical steps break into three main areas: **infrastructure setup**, **feature-wise backend implementation**, and **frontend integration**.

---

## ✅ Next Steps After Defining DB Models

---

### 🔧 1. **Set Up Project Infrastructure**

#### ✅ Backend Setup

* [ ] Set up FastAPI project structure (`app/`, `routers/`, `models/`, `schemas/`, `db/`, `services/`, etc.)
* [ ] Set up `Motor` MongoDB client in `db/mongo.py`
* [ ] Set up `boto3` client for AWS S3 in `utils/s3.py`
* [ ] Set up JWT utilities in `auth/jwt.py` using `python-jose`
* [ ] Set up WebSocket manager in `websockets/manager.py`

Example folder structure:

```
app/
├── auth/
│   └── jwt.py
├── db/
│   └── mongo.py
├── models/
│   └── models.py
├── routers/
│   ├── users.py
│   ├── videos.py
│   └── comments.py
├── utils/
│   └── s3.py
├── main.py
```

---

### 🔐 2. **Implement Authentication**

* [ ] **Signup route**: `/auth/register`
* [ ] **Login route**: `/auth/login`
* [ ] Hash password using `passlib`
* [ ] Generate JWT token and return to frontend
* [ ] Auth middleware to protect routes (dependency that verifies JWT)

---

### 📹 3. **Implement Core API Routes**

These correspond to your MVP features:

#### `/videos`

* [ ] `POST /upload`: Upload video metadata + upload file to S3
* [ ] `GET /feed`: Get paginated video feed (for infinite scroll)
* [ ] `GET /{video_id}`: Get single video info

#### `/likes`

* [ ] `POST /like`: Add like
* [ ] `DELETE /unlike`: Remove like

#### `/comments`

* [ ] `POST /comment`: Add comment
* [ ] `GET /comments/{video_id}`: Get comments on a video

#### `/users`

* [ ] `GET /me`: Get current user profile
* [ ] `GET /{user_id}`: Get user info

---

### 📡 4. **Set Up WebSockets (FastAPI)**

* [ ] Create `/ws` WebSocket endpoint
* [ ] Implement `ConnectionManager` for broadcasting real-time likes/comments
* [ ] Broadcast new comments/likes to relevant users

---

### ☁️ 5. **Set Up AWS S3 for Video Upload**

* [ ] Use `boto3` to:

  * Upload videos
  * Generate signed URLs if needed
* [ ] Store `s3_url` and optional `thumbnail_url` in MongoDB

---

### 🌐 6. **Create Frontend UI (React + Tailwind)**

After backend API is testable:

* [ ] Login/Register UI (token saved to `localStorage`)
* [ ] Video Feed component (autoplay + infinite scroll)
* [ ] Upload form (video file + optional description)
* [ ] Like/Comment buttons (WebSocket updates)
* [ ] Profile page
* [ ] Use `axios` or `fetch` to call FastAPI APIs

---

### 🧪 7. **Testing**

* [ ] Use `pytest` + `httpx` for async route testing
* [ ] Add basic unit tests for key routes and logic
* [ ] Manual test with Postman or Swagger UI (`/docs`)

Great — now that your video router structure is finalized and mounted cleanly in `main.py`, you're ready to move forward with **implementing the logic** behind each grouped router. Here's a step-by-step roadmap from here:

---

### ✅ **Next Steps: Implement Each Video Router**

#### 1. **`video_create_router.py`** – *Upload, Draft, Finalize*

Handles:

* ✅ `POST /upload-url` (generate pre-signed S3 URL)
* ✅ `POST /drafts` (create new draft)
* ✅ `PATCH /drafts/{draft_id}` (update draft info)
* ✅ `POST /finalize` (convert draft → video)

You’ll need:

* `S3Service` (for presigned URLs)
* `VideoDraftRepository`
* `VideoRepository`

---

#### 2. **`video_manage_router.py`** – *Edit, Delete, Privacy, Feature*

Handles:

* ✅ `DELETE /{video_id}`
* ✅ `PATCH /{video_id}/privacy`
* ✅ `PATCH /{video_id}/feature`

You’ll need:

* `VideoRepository`
* Possibly `VideoPolicy`/ownership checks

---

#### 3. **`video_explore_router.py`** – *Playback, Discoverability, Views*

Handles:

* ✅ `GET /stream/{video_id}`
* ✅ `GET /thumbnail/{video_id}`
* ✅ `POST /{video_id}/views`
* ✅ `GET /featured`
* ✅ `GET /search`

You’ll need:

* `VideoRepository`
* `ViewTrackerService` (optional)
* S3 for thumbnails

---

#### 4. **`video_interact_router.py`** – *Like, Comment (optional for now)*

Handles:

* ✅ `POST /{video_id}/like`
* ✅ `DELETE /{video_id}/unlike`
* ✅ `POST /{video_id}/comment`
* ✅ `GET /{video_id}/comments`

You already have a dedicated like/comment router, so this may **not** be needed unless you decide to centralize engagement under videos.

---

### 🔁 **Integration Notes**

* All routers share:

  * `get_logged_in_user()`
  * `VideoRepository`, `VideoDraftRepository`
  * Common response schemas (e.g., `VideoResponse`, `DraftResponse`)
* If needed, create a **`services/video/`** directory with submodules:

  * `upload.py`, `draft.py`, `edit.py`, `explore.py`, etc.

---

### 🚀 Want to proceed now?

Just let me know which router you’d like to begin implementing (e.g., `video_create_router.py`), and I’ll scaffold the endpoints + service/repo logic for you.
